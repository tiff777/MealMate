## Project Introduction

Have you ever wanted to find friends to have lunch with? Or maybe you want to share food interests but cannot find people? In the first week of school, you have no friends but want to find someone to eat with? **MealMate can help you!**

MealMate is a social networking platform that connects university students and professionals through shared dining experiences. In a world where making genuine connections can be challenging, especially for new students or people in new cities, MealMate bridges the gap by using food as a universal connector.

The platform enables users to create meal events, discover dining partners with similar tastes, and build meaningful relationships through the universal language of food.

## Theme Relationship - Networking Through Food

**MealMate perfectly embodies this year's "Networking" theme through several key aspects:**

### ü§ù Social Connection Through Food

- Food is something everyone loves and shares - it's a natural conversation starter
- When you eat with someone, you naturally start talking and making friends
- The app transforms dining from a solitary activity into a social networking opportunity

### üåü Building Real Connections

- Helps users build genuine relationships, not just online friendships
- Perfect for new students looking for lunch buddies
- Ideal for working professionals wanting to expand their social circle
- Essential for people who just moved to a new city

### üéØ Networking Made Natural

- Removes the awkwardness of traditional networking events
- Creates comfortable, low-pressure environments for meeting new people
- Uses shared food interests as the foundation for lasting relationships

The warm orange color scheme reinforces this networking theme - orange represents warmth, energy, and appetite, creating a welcoming atmosphere that encourages users to reach out and connect with others.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for containerized deployment)
- [SQL Server LocalDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb) (for local development)

### Configuration Files Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Set up configuration files before running the application**

#### Backend Configuration

1. **Create `appsettings.json`** in the `backend/` directory:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "[Azure_SQL_Server_Link]"
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "Key": "[YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY_HERE]",
    "Issuer": "MealMate",
    "Audience": "MealMateUsers"
  },
  "dummyPassword": {
    "user1": "[HASHED_PASSWORD_1]",
    "user2": "[HASHED_PASSWORD_2]",
    "user3": "[HASHED_PASSWORD_3]",
    "user4": "[HASHED_PASSWORD_4]",
    "user5": "[HASHED_PASSWORD_5]",
    "user6": "[HASHED_PASSWORD_6]"
  }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note: Replace placeholders with actual values:

- Generate a strong JWT key (minimum 32 characters)
- Use properly hashed passwords for demo users
- Contact the developer for the actual configuration values needed for local development

#### Frontend Configuration

1. **Create `.env`** in the `frontend/` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL= [API_URL]
```

### Local Development Setup

#### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Update database (creates MealMate database)
dotnet ef database update

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5050`

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Docker Deployment

#### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Configuration files set up (see [Configuration Files Setup](#configuration-files-setup))
- Demo avatar images in backend/wwwroot/avatars/ directory
- **Alternative**: For local development without Docker, see [Local Development Setup](#local-development-setup)

#### Quick Start with Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd mealmate

# Ensure configuration files are in place
# (see Configuration Files Setup section above)

# Start all services
docker-compose up --build
```

**Access URLs:**

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5050`

#### Individual Container Deployment

**Backend Container:**

```bash
cd backend

# Ensure appsettings.json exists in backend directory
# Build Docker image
docker build -t mealmate-backend .

# Run container
docker run -p 5050:5050 mealmate-backend
```

**Frontend Container:**

```bash
cd frontend

# Ensure .env file exists in frontend directory
# Build Docker image
docker build -t mealmate-frontend .

# Run container
docker run -p 5173:5173 mealmate-frontend
```

#### Docker Environment Variables

The application automatically detects Docker environment via `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true` and switches to:

- SQLite database instead of SQL Server
- Simplified CORS policy
- Disabled HTTPS redirection
- Container-optimized settings

### Running Tests

#### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
dotnet test
```

#### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development vs Production

Local vs Docker Environment
Local Development Environment

Backend: Uses Azure SQL server (configured in appsettings.json)
Frontend: Uses http://localhost:5050 for API calls (configured in .env)
HTTPS: Enabled with certificate validation
CORS: Restricted to localhost origins with credentials
Database: Persistent SQL Server database with seeded data

Docker Environment

Backend: Uses Azure SQL server for deployment (configured via AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION environment variable)
Frontend: Uses same configuration as local development
HTTPS: Disabled in containers for compatibility
CORS: Open for cross-origin requests
Database: Lightweight SQLite with automatic schema creation

Configuration File Locations
‚úÖ Required Files:

```
backend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ appsettings.json          # Main configuration (REQUIRED)

frontend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                      # Environment variables (REQUIRED)

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes:

- Configuration contains placeholder values for security
- Real JWT keys and hashed passwords should be kept private
- Contact the project maintainer for actual configuration values
- Never commit real connection strings or secrets to git
- The .env files should be gitignored (except .env.example)

## API Documentation

When running locally, visit `http://localhost:5050/swagger` for interactive API documentation.
